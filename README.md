An ultra-quick reference for programming languages with minimal theory and maximum code snippets

## Background

During the final few weeks of the year 2019, and after having attended the [EmacsConf 2019](https://emacsconf.org/2019), I started my adventures with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) (thanks to [Perry E. Metzger](https://twitter.com/perrymetzger) for his amazing and [enlightening presentation](https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/26.html), which itself was a follow-up to [his previous talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8) he presented in 2014).

Despite being ultra-fascinated with this modern statically-typed systems programming language for a few months, I found that I wasn't been able to do justice to the language. Getting pulled into other [super-interesting](https://github.com/myTerminal/twiner) and [moderately-interesting](https://github.com/myTerminal/dotfiles) (and other non-interesting) stuff, I wasn't been able to focus much in this area and often had to relearn many concepts over and over again, within the same week.

One way I avoid getting into such issues is to implement a useful tool in the language/technology I'm learning even before I finished learning enough so that the concepts stick in my mind (or at least in my project(s)), but that has not been possible either with Rust yet (at least as of this writing).

Almost every problem has a solution and according to what I've seen in the last decade, most of them can be solved with a GitHub repo. Presenting **language-speedruns**: A super-concise reference for programming constructs and concepts with minimal theory and maximum code snippets.

**Bonus:** Rust may not be the only topic here, there could be many other languages in the future!

## Potential uses of this project

- An ultra-quick, to-the-point reference for curious programming enthusiasts
- A cheatsheet for practicing online coding problems
- My personal notebook and secondary brain (because I figure that my primary one is very volatile)

## Contents

(It's a little lonely here at the moment, hopefully not for long)

1. [Rust](rust.md)

## To-Do

- Add more Rust concepts
- Evaluate other languages that can be added here
